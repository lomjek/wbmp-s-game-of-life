# Hello and welcome to wbmps game of life,
which is basically the Conways game of life, but instead it works with WBMP images as frames. It is a small hobby project done by us two over the course of two weeks enjoy.
### Why C?
Mainly for the sake of challenge but also because you can easily do bitwise stuff in this language in my opinion.
### Why WBMP?
WBMP files are simple and only have values 0 = black and 1 = white. They are easy to deal with and I created the loader within a day, so...
They also don't take much that space, because you have only two colours. They are not compressed.
### Why SCons?
Godot uses it and it felt cool, so I said, why not -> We use it now. 
You want makefiles?
*make* them yourself.
### Do we have future plans with this?
No.
### Should we add something?
If it is not a really, really good idea, feel free to make it yourself, because we won't do it.
Thank you for your patience.
